Audio Visualizer 

What my assignment does

My assignment is simply an audio visualizer that starts off with a group of spheres changing with the music as well as a set of 8 cubes which store 8 different frequencies.
 The spheres change size with the music both bigger and smaller while the cubes each have their own frequencies that they react to.
 I've also added in lights that change with the music and travel along the lower part of the cubes too.
 The camera should also rotate around the scene which the player can control.
 The music is a song I have loved since I was a kid and I thought the drums would look great in the visualizer which is “Disturbed - Haunted”
There are some post processing effects like bloom in the scene to make the colors pop.

Controls & How to run
The controls for the camera are simply left and right arrow keys to move the camera in and out.
The game should run itself from the .exe file.

What I am most proud of
Creating this scene was tough but I managed to implement a lot of what i wanted to. When I made the frequency bands which moved with different hertz values I was happy that it worked but disappointed in the motion. 
Creating the frequency bands.
Adding the buffer to the frequency bands.
Instantiating the spheres in the position and group I liked
